                The UK planning system has long been burdened by slow processes, limited transparency, and inefficient communication between stakeholders. With average application decisions taking 8-13 weeks, and major developments often extending beyond 6 months, the need for innovation is clear.

              <p className="text-lg">
                Our platform revolutionizes this outdated system by creating a seamless digital bridge between residents, developers, and local authorities. By streamlining communication and providing real-time updates, we're reducing decision times while improving the quality of community engagement.

                Through data-driven insights and transparent processes, we're building a future where planning decisions are made faster, smarter, and with genuine community input. Our goal is to reduce planning decision times by 40% while ensuring every voice is heard.
