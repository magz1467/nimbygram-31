# NimbyGram Static Site

This is a static version of the NimbyGram site while we resolve build issues with the React application.

## Deployment

This site is configured for deployment on Netlify with minimal build requirements:

1. The build script simply copies the index.html file to the dist directory
2. No build tools or dependencies are required
3. The site is completely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Next Steps

Once this static site is successfully deployed, we'll gradually add back the React components and functionality.
